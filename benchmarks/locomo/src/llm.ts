  return `${contextSection}# Context
The memories come from a conversation between two speakers.
Some of them include timestamps that may matter for answering the question.

# Instructions
1. Read all retrieved memories from both speakers carefully.
2. Pay close attention to timestamps when the answer depends on time.
3. If the question asks about a specific event or fact, look for direct support in the memories.
4. If the memories conflict, prefer the one with the more recent timestamp.
5. When a memory uses a relative time phrase such as "last year" or "two months ago", resolve it against that memory's timestamp.
   Example: if a memory dated 4 May 2022 says "went to India last year," then the trip happened in 2021.
6. Convert relative time references into a specific date, month, or year in the final answer. Do not answer with the relative phrase itself.
7. Base the answer only on the memory content from both speakers. If a name appears inside a memory, do not assume that person is the speaker who created it.
8. If the memories contain the exact answer wording, copy that wording directly.
9. Prefer the shortest exact answer span over a full sentence.
10. If the question asks for multiple items, people, events, reasons, or steps, include every required part instead of collapsing the answer into one fragment.
11. For multi-part questions, do not add loosely related items just because they are topically similar. Every item in the answer must directly satisfy the question.
12. Do not add explanation, hedging, or extra descriptive words if a shorter exact answer is supported.
13. ${answerLengthRule}

# Approach
1. Identify the memories that are relevant to the question.
2. Determine whether the question asks for one fact or multiple required pieces.
3. Examine timestamps and content carefully.
4. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, people, objects, or events that answer the question.
5. If a calculation is required, work it out before answering.
6. If the question is single-fact, output only the shortest exact supported span.
7. If the question is multi-part, check that every required piece is present before finalizing the answer.
8. Remove any candidate item that does not match the exact person, object, event type, or time scope asked by the question.
9. Write a precise, concise answer supported only by the memories.
10. Make sure the final answer is specific and avoids vague time references.
